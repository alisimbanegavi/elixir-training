RUNNING TESTS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Elixir ships with a built-in testing framework called ExUnit. ExUnit strives to be clear and explicit, keeping magic to a minimum
- The test/3 macro receives three arguments:
    - Test name
    - Testing context that we are pattern matching on
    - Contents of the test.
- When writing tests in Elixir, we use assertions to check that something is true

CONN CASE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* EXAMPLE IN 'test/support/conn_case.ex'

VIEW TESTS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* EXAMPLE IN test/hello_web/views/error_view_test.exs

TAGS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* EXAMPLE IN hello/test/hello_web/views/error_view_test.exs
- ExUnit allows us to tag our tests individually or for the whole module 
- We can then choose to run only the tests with a specific tag, or we can exclude tests with that tag and run everything else
- Use tags by appending '@moduletag :[tag name]' after 'use ...' statement[s]
- We can run only the tests from the module we tag by running 'mix test --only [tag name]'
    - We can also do the opposite by running 'mix test --exclude [tag name]'
- To tag an individual test, append '@tag [test name]: [test value]' right before the test
    - We can reuse the test name, but test values attacheed will be different
    - Can run tags with a specific value using i.e. 'mix test --only individual_test:yup'

RANDOMIZATION----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Running tests in random order is a good way to ensure that our tests are truly isolated
- If a test results in sporadic failures it may be because a previous test changes the state of the system in ways that aren't cleaned up afterward
- This subsequently affects the tests which follow 
- Those failures might only present themselves if the tests are run in a specific order

- ExUnit will randomize the order tests run in by default, using an integer to seed the randomization
- If a specific random seed triggers intermittent failure, we can re-run the tests with that same seed
- This reliably recreated that test sequence in order to help us figure out what the problem is

CONCURRENCY & PARITIONING-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ExUnit allows developers to run tests concurrently
- ExUnit also supports out of the box test partitioning in test environments
